# Traffic Light Simulator, FSM based

this is a FSM approach for simulating traffic.

using several libraries:
1. [javascript-state-machines](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine) by jake gordon
1. [redux](https://redux.js.org/) by Dan Abramov
1. [redux-actions](https://github.com/reduxactions/redux-actions) by Andrew Clark

It tries it best to follow FSM terms and definition.

where State represent light ('red', 'yellow', 'green')

and redux store is used to provide variable storing and dispatching mechanism.
